            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
              Founded by engineers and entrepreneurs passionate about public
              innovation, EyeQlytics began with CopMap to digitize India's
              police deployment workflows. What started as a solution for
              police deployment tracking has grown into a comprehensive
              platform for public sector digital transformation.

              Our founders, driven by a passion for public service and
              technology innovation, recognized the gap between cutting-edge
              technology and its application in government operations. Today,
              we bridge that gap with solutions that are both technologically
              advanced and practically applicable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">
              Since then, our mission has expanded to solving overlooked
              challenges across sectors through scalable, secure, and
              user-focused software systems. We believe that technology should
              serve people, not the other way around.
